## Code quality

### Java

- Generally following the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- **IntelliJ** Recommended: Code style formatting is in `.idea` folder
- It is expected to write a test for each functionality.

### JS/TS

- **VisualCode** recommended: code formatting and properties are defined in `.vscode` folder
- We are yet to establish a proper test framework. A proposal would be welcome.
