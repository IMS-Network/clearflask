## Hosting

### Cloud

For cloud hosting, sign up [here](https://clearflask.com/signup) to get started.

### Self-hosting

*Note*: self-hosting has not yet been optimized for single-customer use case and light-weight deployment. Any help would
be appreciated. We need to complete the following:

- [ ] Replace DynamoDB, ElasticSearch, S3, SES with PostgreSQL, SMTP.
- [x] Stub out Payment Processor dependency
- [ ] Alternative landing page and dashboard for single-customer use-case
- [ ] Dockerize and publish
- [ ] Create Installation instructions
