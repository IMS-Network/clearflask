## Architecture

Look at our [architecture page](ARCHITECTURE.md) to better understand the layout of this project.

## Building

See how you can [build ClearFlask](BUILDING.md) locally

## Code style

Java:

- Generally following the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- **IntelliJ** Recommended: Code style formatting is in `.idea` folder

JS/TS:

- **VisualCode** recommended: code formatting and properties are defined in `.vscode` folder

## Testing

For **Java** code, it is generally expected a test is written for each change.

For **JS/TS**, we are yet to establish a proper test framework. A proposal would be welcome.
